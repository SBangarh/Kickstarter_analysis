# Kickstarter_analysis

## Purpose
To develop a model that can predict the success or failure of a Kickstarter campaign using data downloaded from [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NADAC/studies/38050)
There is also opportunity to test the model on other Kickstarter datasets like [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sripaadsrinivasan/kickstarter-campaigns-dataset) and [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects)

## About the Data
Raw data has 21 features and ~507k instances in a tsv file. Data ranges from 2009 to 2020.

## Process
First step was perform EDA - load the data and get it ready for analysis by dropping columns, changing datatypes, and performing some feature engineering
